# Introduction
Thank you for visiting this github repo.  It's the public repository for https://www.policexray.com.  Here you'll find code on how to setup the repo, re-create results, and contribute to the project if you'd like.

# About
The police xray project was designed to allow machine learning, policing outcomes, open data, interactive visualizations and reproducible code to give both experts and laypersons the ability to explore how factors like someone's age, location, race and behavior interact to determine how someone gets searched or arrested.  

The project has three different interfaces:

 - A public website at https://www.policexray.com, that allows people to do scenario analysis to see how a person's characteristics and behavior influence police outcomes
 - An api at https://www.police-project-test.xyz/api that allows developers to access the project's statistical model as a service, either to explore it programmatically or re-use it in their own ways
 - This github repo, which will allow you to re-run our analysis from the command line and explore project artifacts directly
